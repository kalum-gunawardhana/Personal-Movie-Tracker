                        Redemption. The film tells the story of banker Andy Dufresne, who is sentenced to life in
                        Shawshank State Penitentiary for the murders of his wife and her lover, despite his claims of
                        innocence. Over the following two decades, he befriends a fellow prisoner, contraband smuggler
                        Ellis "Red" Redding, and becomes instrumental in a money laundering operation led by the prison
                        warden Samuel Norton. William Sadler, Clancy Brown, Gil Bellows, and James Whitmore appear in
                        supporting roles</p>
